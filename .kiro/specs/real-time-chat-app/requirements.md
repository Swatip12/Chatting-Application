# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a full-stack real-time chatting application that enables users to communicate instantly through one-to-one and group messaging. The system consists of a Spring Boot backend with WebSocket support, an Angular frontend, and MySQL database for persistent storage.

## Glossary

- **Chat_System**: The complete real-time chatting application including backend, frontend, and database components
- **User**: A registered individual who can send and receive messages through the system
- **Message**: A text communication sent from one user to another or to a group
- **WebSocket_Connection**: A persistent bidirectional communication channel between client and server
- **Online_Status**: The current availability state of a user (online/offline)
- **Chat_Room**: A virtual space where users can exchange messages
- **Authentication_Service**: The component responsible for user login and registration
- **Message_History**: The persistent storage of all messages exchanged in the system
